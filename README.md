Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience, passionate about building scalable and maintainable applications. My main focus is .NET Clean Architecture, where I love designing complex solutions that are both efficient and elegant.

ðŸ’¡ What drives me?
Crafting well-structured backend systems that stand the test of time
Exploring new architectural patterns to keep improving
Writing clean, maintainable code that makes life easier for developers
ðŸ”¥ Always leveling up
Tech never stands still, and neither do I. I'm always learning, whether it's diving into new frameworks, refining best practices, or solving challenging problems. Every project is an opportunity to grow and push the boundaries of what I can build.

ðŸš€ Let's build something awesome
If you're passionate about scalable architecture, clean code, or just love discussing tech, let's connect and create something great together!
